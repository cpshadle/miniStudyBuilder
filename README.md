# miniStudyBuilder

This is a draft of a clinical study designer that enables you to identify clinical study requirements and generate a USDM.JSON file containing critical data, including biomedical concepts.  

To be clear, this is as much a tool for understanding clinical study design as it is for understanding the USDM 4.0 model.
